Pseudo Loot Filter

This D2RMM mod allows to replace specific base item drops with no drop. 
The Goal of the mod is to reduce item clutter beyond what is currently possible with other D2RMM mods: 
- Decrease Clutter Drops [https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/255](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/255) 
- Reduce Item Clutter [https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/421](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/421)

The mod allows the selection of no drop chance for the follwing:
- misc items
- gem qualities
- runes (up to Fal Rune)
- all individual armors and weapons in the game: starting from treasure class 3 and up to treasure class 87 (the highest in the game)

By replacing the original base item's drop chance with no drop there is no intended change in any item drop probability. 
If you suspect the original drop chances are affected by this mod do not hesitate to contact me.

Credits to:
- Warren1001 and unadorned for many many tips on the game internals and mainly for coming up with the idea to simply recreate the auto generated treasure classes and replace the references of the ones the game created with my own. Before this I was stuck and couldn't figure out how to change weapons.txt, armor.txt and itemtypes.txt to make the game create the auto TCs with removed items and drop chances unaltered
- olegbl for creating D2RMM
- Bonsey as well for giving a few tips on how to better understand .txt files
- The orginal creators of the mods that inspired this mod

D2RMM worked best for me starting out but D2 Remodded may be a better alternative for you.
